        STUDENT EXERCISE - #3
        <br>
        THE AGE CALCULATOR
        <br>
        Forgot how old you are? Calculate it!
        <br>
        Write a function named calculateAge that:
        <br>
        takes 2 arguments: birth year, current year.
        <br>
        calculates the age based on those years.
        <br>
        outputs the result to the screen like so: "You are NN years old"
        <br>
        Call the function three times with different sets of values.
        <br>
        Bonus: Figure out how to get the current year in JavaScript instead of passing it in.
        <br>
        Time to accomplish: 15 minutes.
